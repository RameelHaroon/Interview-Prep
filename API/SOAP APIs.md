**SOAP APIs** (Simple Object Access Protocol APIs) are a type of web service communication protocol that uses **XML** for message formatting and usually relies on **HTTP** or **SMTP** as the transport protocol. SOAP is known for being highly standardized and **strongly typed**, making it a good choice for enterprise-level applications that require robust security and transaction support.

Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a message specification for exchanging information between systems and applications. When it comes to application programming interfaces ([APIs](https://www.postman.com/what-is-an-api/)), a SOAP API is developed in a more structured and formalized way. Think of SOAP as being like the national postal service: It provides a reliable and trusted way to send and receive messages between systems (and within enterprise applications). It is older, established, and dependableâ€”but it can be slower than competing architectural styles like REST.

- SOAP is a **protocol** (unlike REST, which is an architectural style).
- All data is sent in **XML format**, structured within an **envelope**
- Most SOAP APIs use **HTTP/HTTPS**, though **SMTP, FTP**, and others are also supported.
